        <h2 class="text-2xl font-serif mb-4">The Importance of Precise Measurements</h2>
        <p class="mb-4">In the world of tailoring, measurements are everything. A difference of just half an inch can transform a garment from perfectly fitted to uncomfortably tight or awkwardly loose.</p>
        
        <h3 class="text-xl font-serif mt-6 mb-3">Key Measurement Points</h3>
        <ul class="list-disc pl-6 mb-4">
          <li class="mb-2">Chest/Bust: Measure around the fullest part</li>
          <li class="mb-2">Waist: Measure at the natural waistline</li>
          <li class="mb-2">Hips: Measure around the fullest part</li>
          <li class="mb-2">Shoulders: From shoulder seam to shoulder seam</li>
          <li class="mb-2">Sleeve Length: From shoulder to wrist</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3 class="text-xl font-serif mt-6 mb-3">Pro Tips</h3>
        <p class="mb-4">Always measure over undergarments similar to what will be worn with the garment. Stand naturally with arms at your sides. Use a flexible measuring tape and keep it parallel to the floor for horizontal measurements.</p>

        <p class="mb-4">This summer, fabrics are all about breathability, sustainability, and texture. Here are the top trends dominating the season:</p>
        
        <h3 class="text-xl font-serif mt-6 mb-3">Linen Takes Center Stage</h3>
        <p class="mb-4">Linen continues to be the fabric of choice for summer due to its natural breathability and effortless elegance. This year, we're seeing linen blends that reduce wrinkling while maintaining the fabric's signature texture.</p>
        
        <h3 class="text-xl font-serif mt-6 mb-3">Recycled Cotton Gains Popularity</h3>
        <p class="mb-4">Sustainable fashion pushes forward with high-quality recycled cotton fabrics that offer the same comfort as virgin cotton with a significantly lower environmental impact.</p>
        
        <h3 class="text-xl font-serif mt-6 mb-3">Technical Fabrics for Everyday Wear</h3>
        <p class="mb-4">Moisture-wicking, UV-protective fabrics originally developed for athletic wear are now being incorporated into everyday summer clothing.</p>

        <h2 class="text-2xl font-serif mb-4">Wool Care Essentials</h2>
        <p class="mb-4">Wool is a natural, durable fiber that can last for decades with proper care. Follow these guidelines to maintain your wool garments:</p>
        
        <h3 class="text-xl font-serif mt-6 mb-3">Cleaning Wool</h3>
        <p class="mb-4">Most wool garments should be dry cleaned or hand washed in cold water with a mild detergent. Never wring or twist wool - instead, gently press out excess water and lay flat to dry.</p>
        
        <h3 class="text-xl font-serif mt-6 mb-3">Storage Tips</h3>
        <p class="mb-4">Store wool in a cool, dry place. Use cedar blocks or lavender sachets to deter moths rather than chemical mothballs which can damage the fibers. Always clean wool before storing to remove any food particles or stains that might attract pests.</p>
        
        <h3 class="text-xl font-serif mt-6 mb-3">Dealing with Pilling</h3>
        <p class="mb-4">Pilling is normal with wool. Use a fabric shaver or sweater stone to remove pills, never pull them off as this can damage the fibers.</p>

        <h2 class="text-2xl font-serif mb-4">The Evolution of Bespoke Tailoring</h2>
        <p class="mb-4">Bespoke tailoring has a rich history dating back centuries, evolving from a necessity to an art form.</p>
        
        <h3 class="text-xl font-serif mt-6 mb-3">Early Origins</h3>
        <p class="mb-4">The concept of custom-made clothing dates back to ancient civilizations, but modern bespoke tailoring emerged in 17th century London. The term "bespoke" comes from the practice of "speaking for" or reserving particular fabrics.</p>
        
        <h3 class="text-xl font-serif mt-6 mb-3">Savile Row and Beyond</h3>
        <p class="mb-4">London's Savile Row became the epicenter of bespoke tailoring in the 19th century, setting standards for quality that persist today. Each suit required multiple fittings and could take up to 50 hours of handwork.</p>
        
        <h3 class="text-xl font-serif mt-6 mb-3">Modern Bespoke</h3>
        <p class="mb-4">Today, bespoke tailoring combines traditional techniques with modern technology. While machine assistance is common, the hallmark of true bespoke remains the skilled handwork of master tailors.</p>

        <h2 class="text-2xl font-serif mb-4">Fabric Choices for Every Body Type</h2>
        <p class="mb-4">The right fabric can enhance your best features and create a balanced silhouette. Here's how to choose:</p>
        
        <h3 class="text-xl font-serif mt-6 mb-3">For Petite Frames</h3>
        <p class="mb-4">Light to medium weight fabrics with some drape work best. Avoid heavy fabrics that can overwhelm a small frame. Consider fabrics like silk, lightweight wool, or cotton blends.</p>
        
        <h3 class="text-xl font-serif mt-6 mb-3">For Tall Figures</h3>
        <p class="mb-4">You can carry heavier fabrics well. Look for structured fabrics like tweed, heavier wool, or denim. These help add definition to your silhouette.</p>
        
        <h3 class="text-xl font-serif mt-6 mb-3">For Curvy Shapes</h3>
        <p class="mb-4">Medium weight fabrics with some stretch provide comfort and shape. Avoid stiff fabrics that don't drape. Ponte knit, stretch wool, and jersey are excellent choices.</p>
